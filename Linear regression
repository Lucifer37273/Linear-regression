# Step 1: Import Libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error

# Step 2: Load Data (replace with your own data)
# Example: Load from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Step 3: Select Features (X) and Target (y)
# Example: Using 'Experience' to predict 'Salary'
X = df[['Experience']] # Independent variable(s)
y = df['Salary']      # Dependent variable

# Step 4: Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Train the Linear Regression Model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Make Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 7: Evaluate the Model
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False) # squared=False returns RMSE

print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
print(f"RMSE: {rmse}")

# You can also get the model's coefficients (slope) and intercept
print(f"Model Slope (coefficient): {model.coef_}")
print(f"Model Intercept: {model.intercept_}")
